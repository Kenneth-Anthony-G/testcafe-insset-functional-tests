      The browser window was resized during the "Test1" test while TestCafe recorded a video. TestCafe cannot adjust the video resolution during recording. As a result, the video content may appear broken. Do not resize the browser window when TestCafe records a video.
    --
      The "${TEST_INDEX}" path pattern placeholder cannot be applied to the recorded video.
